.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Boggle
is a solitaire game, based on the Parker Brothers game, in which the
object is to find as many words as possible within the board in a
given time. The board consists of a rectangular arrangement of
letters. A word is found by tracing a connected chain of letters. Each
letter must be adjacent to the next horizontally, vertically, or
diagonally. Letters may not be reused within a single word.
.P
The configuration matching the original Parker Brothers game uses a
4x4 grid of letters and a minimum word length of three letters. The
configuration for the sequel uses a 5x5 grid and a four-letter
minimum. (And both configurations have a three-minute time limit.)
Other configurations can be specified via the command-line options.
.P
During a game the program will automatically reject illegal words
(i.e., words that are too short, cannot be legally made, or are not in
the dictionary). At the end of each game the program will then display
the remaining words that were possible to make, and a running
score. These features can also be altered via the command-line
options.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-h
Display help and exit.
.TP
.BI \-v
Display version number and exit.
.TP
.BI \-b " mn"
Specifies a custom grid size of
.I m
x
.IR n ,
with the dimensions being between 2 and 9 (inclusive).
.BR
When the grid is 4x4 or 5x5, the program uses the letter probabilities
given by the original Parker Brothers games. With other grid sizes,
the program computes its own probabilities, based upon the letter
frequencies of the English language.
.TP
.BI \-b " n"
Same as above, giving a square grid of size
.I n
x
.IR n .
.TP
.BI \-w " n"
Specifies a minimum word length of
.I n
letters.
.I n
must be greater than one.
.TP
.BI \-4
Equivalent to 
.BR "-b 4 -w 3" .
.TP
.BI \-5
Equivalent to
.BR "-b 5 -w 4" .
.TP
.BI \-t " n"
Specifies the amount of time for each game as
.I n
seconds.
.TP
.BI \-p
Postpones "filtering" until after the game. By default, when an
illegal word is entered it is immediately rejected. Using this option
leaves all checking (except word length) to be done at the end of the
game.
.TP
.BI \-s
"Save my ego": the program will not show you the words that you missed
at the end of the game.
.TP
.BI \-l
Suppresses the use of VT100-style line-drawing characters. Use this
flag if terminfo reports that your terminal can use line-drawing
characters when it actually cannot.
.TP
.BI \-d " path"
Specifies
.I path
as the pathname of the dictionary file.
.P
The following options enable different features of the program. They
both accept multiple arguments, and so must be the last options on the
command line.
.TP
.BI \-B
"Batch mode": Use of this option causes the program to run as a
filter. The arguments should be a series of letters that are used to
fill the grid (left-to-right, top-to-bottom). The input should consist
of a wordlist (i.e., one word per line).  The words that can be found
in the specified grid are echoed to the output. This option can be
used in conjunction with
.BR -b ,
.BR -w ,
.BR -4
and
.BR -5 ;
all other options are ignored. The dictionary file is not consulted
when in this mode.
.TP
.BI \-D
"Dictionary compiler": Use this option to compile a new dictionary
file. The arguments should be the pathname(s) of one or more
wordlists, and the union of their contents is compiled into the
dictionary file. If no wordlists are specified, standard input is used
by default. This option can be used in conjunction with
.BR -d ;
all other options are ignored.
.SH INPUT KEYS
When the program is waiting for a word to be input, the following keys
have special meaning.
.TP
.B SPC
completes the input (same as
.BR RET ).
.TP
.B ^U ^W
erases what has been typed so far.
.TP
.B ^T
transposes the last two letters typed.
.TP
.B ^L ^R
redraws the entire screen.
.TP
.B ^D
cancels input and ends the current game.
.TP
.B ?
displays the brief online help.
.P
After a game has ended, the following key commands are available.
.TP
.B &
starts a new game.
.TP
.B ^D
exits the program.
.TP
.B -
scrolls the wordlist to the right, if there are more words than can
fit on the screen.
.TP
.B + =
scrolls the wordlist to the left.
.TP
.B ?
prompts for a word from the wordlist, and then shows where the word
can be found.
.SH DICTIONARY
The game requires an external dictionary file (except when used in
batch mode). Any collection of wordlists can be used in conjunction
with the program (using the
.B -D
option) to build a new dictionary. Words in the wordlists that contain
anything other than lowercase letters are automatically ignored, as
capitalized letters are assumed to indicate proper nouns. (Note that
this means that a wordlist stored entirely in uppercase will show as
containing no words.) Words that contain a Q without a U immediately
following are also ignored.
.P
Building the dictionary takes a bit of time; please be patient. The
average dictionary size appears to be roughly 2-3 bytes per word.
.SH FILES
.TP
/usr/local/share/games/boggle.dict
The default pathname for the external dictionary.
