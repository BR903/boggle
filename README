Boggle requires a decent version of ncurses and an ANSI C compiler;
beyond that, it should compile on any modern Unix-like system without
too much trouble.

Boggle requires an external dictionary file (unless you only ue the
batch mode) before it can be used. To build one, use the -D option and
any collection of wordlists. The default location for the dictionary
file is set at compile-time, via the DICTFILEPATH macro, to
/usr/local/share/games/boggle.dict. /usr/local/share may be changed by
using the --datadir switch with ./configure. If you want to change it
further, you should edit the Makefile so that DICTFILEPATH contains
the desired pathname.

If you're looking for a better wordlist for building a dictionary than
what's provided in /usr/dict/words, try the Moby project web pages:
