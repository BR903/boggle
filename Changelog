Version 1.2, ???:
* Numerous incremental improvements and small bug fixes over the years,
  none of which I documented at the time. This version has been sitting on
  my hard drive for years, though, and it does contain bug fixes, so I
  feel that I ought to release it.

Version 1.1, November 1999:
* Minor bug fixes.
* UI improvements.
* Numerous code changes to improve portability.
* Dictionary file format altered to be more extensible and
  platform-independent. It is now possible to share dictionary files
  across platforms.

* Bug fixes.
* Minor UI improvements.
* Minor change to dictionary file format.
* Added dict.doc file to document the dictionary file format, and the
