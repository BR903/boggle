Boggle requires a decent version of ncurses and an ANSI C compiler;
beyond that, it should compile on any modern Unix-like system without
trouble.

To install, use:

$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

Useful options to the configure program are: --prefix, --exec-prefix,
--bindir, --datadir, and --mandir.

Boggle requires an external dictionary file (unless you only need to
use the batch mode) before it can be used. To build one, use the -D
option and any collection of wordlists. For example:

$ ./boggle -D /etc/dictionary/words ./mywords.txt

The program will automatically ignore words that contain any capital
letters, or non-alphabetic characters such as apostrophes.

The default location for the dictionary file is set at compile-time to
/usr/local/share/games/boggle/boggle.dict via the DICTFILEDIR
variable. /usr/local/share may be changed by using the --datadir
option to ./configure. If you want to change it further, you should
edit the Makefile (after running ./configure) so that DICTFILEDIR
contains the desired directory.

Note that many system wordlists are aimed more for use with spelling
checkers, and as such will omit plurals and other common variations.
If you're looking for a better wordlist for building a dictionary than
what's available locally, try a web search for open source word lists.
Or, you can download a pre-built dictionary from this program's web
page at <http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/boggle.html>.
